# Testbed Federation using WebGME
## Installation
### Prerequisites
First, you need to install the following for the tool to work:
- git using homebrew
  ```
  brew install git

  ```
- [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/) (Version 18 highly recommended)
- [Python](https://www.python.org/)
- [Docker desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/)
- MongoDB. Pull the mongodb image in docker desktop and make a new container from it.
  - Steps to create a new container from the image:
    - Click the run button beside the mongo image and set the optional settings.
    - Give a name to your container. I gave it sanjanadb.
    - Set host path as :
      ```
      /Users/yourname/DB

      ```
      Where DB is a folder I created to store all the database contents.

    - â€‹Set the Container path as
      ```
      /data/db
      ```
